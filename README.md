# Tesh

Tesh is a really simple shell based on sh syntax. Nothing fancy or anything.

## Building

To build the the whole project, use make.

```
make
```

## Contributing

Before making a commit, format the code by running:

```
./format.sh
```
(Be sure to have uncrustify installed to run format.sh)

This will make the code nice and clean (as far as indentation and spacing goes).
